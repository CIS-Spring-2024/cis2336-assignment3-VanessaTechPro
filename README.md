I changed the format of menu to be more organized and cleaner. I used sections to seperate the drinks, food, and desserts.
I added the Javascript for the pop-up order section. I used the order now button and implemented a openOrder function to create the pop effect. 
I set the order from to only include order aboce 0 and below or equal to ten to avoid quanitity errors and math errors.
I added alerts to let the consumer know the amounts allowed along with a succesful alert with information such as the item, the quanity, and the total they have ordered.
